Auf der eGK werden die Namensbestandteile \"Namenszusatz\" und \"Vorsatzwort\" getrennt vom Nachnamen gespeichert. Anhand der Liste der zulässigen Namenszusätze ist deutlich erkennbar, dass es sich hierbei sinngemäß um Adelstitel handelt.\r\nDas Vorsatzwort kann durch die Core-Extension own-prefix (Canonical: http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/humanname-own-prefix) abgebildet werden, für den Namenszusatz ergibt sich jedoch die Notwendikeit einer nationalen Extension, da in andern Ländern Adelstitel entweder gar nicht oder als reguläres Namenspräfix erfasst werden.",

Systems providing decision support or enforcing business rules should ideally do this on the basis of Observations dealing with the specific sex or gender aspect of interest (anatomical, chromosomal, social, etc.)  However, because these observations are infrequently recorded, defaulting to the administrative gender is common practice.  Where such defaulting occurs, rule enforcement should allow for the variation between administrative and biological, chromosomal and other gender aspects.  For example, an alert about a hysterectomy on a male should be handled as a warning or overridable error, not a \"hard\" error.
